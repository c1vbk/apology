        <p id="hidden-message" class="hidden">I love you so much, my bb girl. I am sorry for talking about those stuff that made you sad. I should have listened to all of your 
            problems. If I were you, I would also hate all the people around you so I don't think you are wrong for that. You are not responsible for all the sensitive or stupid or 
            stupid or selfish or evil people. I know you hate me also but I hope you would accept this website as I spent a little time doing it. I hope you can forgive me for being 
            a useless boyfriend or your listener. I promise you that if we get married, I will share your problems and make it OUR problem instead of only 
            your problem. If you lazy to cook, I cook, If we both lazy, we order outside and eat the food you are craving for hahaha. I will support you as best as I can and I want 
            to make you the happiest wife on earth. I feel really lucky, to meet you because you are one of the kindest, caring and fun person but you had a bad childhood, and you 
            are unlucky when it comes to making good friends. But you are lucky enough to meet Wunju, Jiaxuan and Me hehe. I hope you know that I am always here for you and I want 
            to apologize to you for being a jibai people. I dont want to be like them. I am not good with words and this is the best I can write so I hope you know my feelings for you
            are real. Btw, dont show this to your friends ya, I shy shy. <br><br>
